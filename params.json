{"name":"RP","body":"# RP\r\n\r\nRP.py is a micro Radio Paradise Player library.\r\n\r\nIt has two interfaces:\r\n\r\n- **RP**, a cli interface with an OSD (based on pynotify/libnotify)\r\n- **qRP**, a Qt interface with a bit more tricks, like history and full size covers. (based on PyQt/PySide)\r\n\r\nIt relies on python-gstreamer and has an mplayer fallback mode if your gstreamer to old.\r\n\r\nRP is licensed under GPLv3+.\r\n\r\nAuthor: Anisse Astier <anisse@astier.eu>\r\n\r\n## History\r\n\r\nI like to listen to Radio Paradise. A lot. I used to launch Amarok just to listen to this webradio. Then, tired of Amarok's footprint, I started using mplayer. A simple wget of the playlist then ``mplayer `cat rp*` ``. This was enough for some time.\r\n\r\nUntil I wanted to know what I was listening to. And _see_ those cover arts that kept taunting me in the ICY Info. Also, at about the same time, I discovered that pynotify was pretty nice and could do neat tricks with minimum amount of code.\r\n\r\nThat's how RP was born.\r\n\r\nThe rest is (in the git) history ;-)","tagline":"a micro Radio Paradise Player","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
